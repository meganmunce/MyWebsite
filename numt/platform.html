<p style="margin-top: 5vh;">Dear NUMT,</p>

<br>
<p>
	First and foremost, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be on exec these two past years. There's truly been no better activity at
	Northwestern and no better group of people than the ones I've met through mock trial, i.e., you all.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	When I originally ran for exec as a freshman, it's because I loved this program, but thought it could do better. That's been true every year I've been on exec, and it's still true now!
	</p><br>

	<p>This year, I want to build upon the work exec has done in the last few years to keep pushing us toward an NUMT that is not only
	a kick<span class="numbers">-</span>ass top <span class="numbers">10</span> at Nationals team, but also an organization that makes people feel
	supported and appreciated. I don't belive that competitiveness comes at the sacrifice of prioritizing people, in fact, I think it's the opposite.<br><br>My philosophy boils down to this:</p>
	<br>
	<h2><span class="orangehighlight">We compete better when we take care of each other.</span></h2>
	<br>
	<p>We all already know this is true. During this year's tryouts, exec added personality questions to the process. The motivation was fundamentally the statement above:
	we recognized that success isn't just about talent, it's about cohesion.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The result was an incredible class of new members that not only led us to our most successful fall and winter seasons potentially ever, but also were kind and
	supportive team members during an incredibly challenging year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>That criterion has guided the decisions I've made as a member of exec, and I want to make sure it's at the forefront of our leadership next year, too.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a member of exec, I've:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Written and passed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyU52YVPBdJiisR6ldvBsmH-88jkqCJwsgYK8v9R8uY/edit" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">an amendment</a></span> to make the stack process more personal by mandating that coaches contact members individually to discuss their results</li>
			<li>Created a program wide <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=dS5ub3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4uZWR1XzJrNWpnMzNxOW50dDBsZWNkdHJpYzRlM21nQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Google Calendar</span></a> to try to facilitate interteam collaboration</li>
			<li>Created an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHbEcX3lMeH7vCFcLMcvwlHPBCGAvpzpi5UZ5fDDvxDlocBg/viewform" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">anonymous feedback form</span></a> to ensure members have a channel to candidly communicate feedback, and also report uncomfortable incidents if necessary</li>
			<li>Adapted to online recruitment via an increased social media presence and a <span class="highlight"><a href="https://meganmunce.github.io/NUMockTrial/Recruitment2020/welcome" target="_blank">custom recruitment website</span><a/></li>
			<li>Added a <a href="https://www.northwesternmocktrial.org/member-resources" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">member resources section </span></a>to the website to aggregate our online resources, new and old</li>
	</ul>

<div class="postitnoteleft" style="float:left;"><span style="text-align: center;">Note:</span><br>All of the blue<br>highlighted words<br> are links!</div>

	<p>That's all to say that I'm someone you can trust to follow through with what they say. Each of the bullet points above started as part of my platform for exec last year and became a reality that <span class="numbers">(</span>I hope!<span class="numbers">)</span> improved the state of the program this year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>But like I said at the beginning, there's still so much work to do.</p>




<br>
<p>Sincerely,<p>
<p style="margin-left: 3vw;">Megan Munce</p>
