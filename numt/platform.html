<p style="margin-top: 5vh;">Dear NUMT,</p>

<br>
<p>
	First and foremost, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be on exec these two past years. There's truly been no better activity at
	Northwestern and no better group of people than the ones I've met through mock trial, i.e., you all.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	When I originally ran for exec as a freshman, it's because I loved this program, but thought it could do better. That's been true every year I've been on exec, and it's still true now!
	</p><br>

	<p>This year, I want to build upon the work exec has done in the last few years to keep pushing us toward an NUMT that is not only
	a kick<span class="numbers">-</span>ass top <span class="numbers">10</span> at Nationals team, but also an organization that makes people feel
	supported and appreciated. I don't belive that competitiveness comes at the sacrifice of prioritizing people, in fact, I think it's the opposite.<br><br>My philosophy boils down to this:</p>
	<br>
	<h2><span class="orangehighlight">We compete better when we take care of each other.</span></h2>
	<br>
	<p>We all already know this is true. During this year's tryouts, exec added personality questions to the process. The motivation was fundamentally the statement above:
	we recognized that success isn't just about talent, it's about cohesion.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The result was an incredible class of new members that not only led us to our most successful fall and winter seasons potentially ever, but also were kind and
	supportive team members during an incredibly challenging year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>That criterion has guided the decisions I've made as a member of exec, and I want to make sure it's at the forefront of our leadership next year, too.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a member of exec, I've:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Written and passed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyU52YVPBdJiisR6ldvBsmH-88jkqCJwsgYK8v9R8uY/edit" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">an amendment</a></span> to make the stack process more personal by mandating that coaches contact members individually to discuss their results</li>
			<li>Created a program wide <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=dS5ub3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4uZWR1XzJrNWpnMzNxOW50dDBsZWNkdHJpYzRlM21nQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Google Calendar</span></a> to try to facilitate interteam collaboration</li>
			<li>Created an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHbEcX3lMeH7vCFcLMcvwlHPBCGAvpzpi5UZ5fDDvxDlocBg/viewform" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">anonymous feedback form</span></a> to ensure members have a channel to candidly communicate feedback, and also report uncomfortable incidents if necessary</li>
			<li>Adapted to online recruitment via an increased social media presence and a <span class="highlight"><a href="https://meganmunce.github.io/NUMockTrial/Recruitment2020/welcome" target="_blank">custom recruitment website</span><a/></li>
			<li>Added a <a href="https://www.northwesternmocktrial.org/member-resources" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">member resources section </span></a>to the website to aggregate our online resources, new and old</li>
	</ul>

<div class="postitnoteleft" style="float:left; padding-bottom: 1.5vw; margin-bottom: 3vw;"><span style="text-align: center;">Note:</span><br>All of the blue<br>highlighted words<br> are links!</div>

	<p>That's all to say that I'm someone you can trust to follow through with what they say. Each of the bullet points above started as part of my platform for exec last year and became a reality that <span class="numbers">(</span>I hope!<span class="numbers">)</span> improved the state of the program this year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>But like I said at the beginning, there's still so much work to do.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Here are just a few of what my priorities would be as president or vice president:</p>


<div class="postitnoteright flipthis" style="float: right; margin-left: 5vw; width: 20vw; padding-bottom: 0;">
	<p style="font-size: 18px;">Roles of the President:<br></p>
	<p style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="numbers" style="font-size: 14px;">(</span>Click to see Vice President<span class="numbers" style="font-size: 14px;">)</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall oversee and assist the operations of the Executive Board and ensure that they are appropriate and efficient</li>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall oversee and introduce the coaches of the program, ensuring that they understand their roles in the organization.</li>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall represent the program when the presidential presence is necessary, including to some funding organizations and to the Student Organization Finance Office <span style=" font-size: 16px;" class="numbers">(</span>SOFO<span style=" font-size: 16px;" class="numbers">)</span></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Incorporate more program input into program decisions</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">The role of exec is to make decisions for the team, but if we want to do that well, we need to make sure we understand what the team needs and give them a way to communicate whether they think that's being achieved.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A pre-season full program meeting to discuss priorities for recruitment, i.e. more character witneses, and for the upcoming year, i.e. more all program meetings, more skill sessions, etc.</li>
	<li>Quarterly townhalls for exec to communicate progress on priorities and for members give exec feedback on how to continue to improve </li>
	<li>Better promote the feedback form as an option for communicating feedback between townhalls</li>
	<li>Conversations with new members to be open and honest about what the program expects them to do and what they expect to get from their program experience</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Focus on growth and goals</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Each of us comes to NUMT with different goals in mind: to be on a certain team, to do a certain role or just to have fun. Keeping that in mind, we need to improve our communication
	about goals and areas for improvement so that coaches, captains and exec can understand how to best improve members' experience and
	members can understand what they need to do to meet their goals.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rewrite pre-season Google forms to better understand each members' goals to know what to work on during fall season</li>
	<li>Use stack result conversations to identify barriers and opportunities for improvement so members know what to work on during winter</li>
	<li>Full program skill sessions led by coaches and older team members so new members have equal access to older members with different skills, regardless of fall team placement</li>
	<li>Standardized fall education so new members on every team recieve a similar fall education</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Reexamine stack</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 18px;">Stack needs to be redefined so it's no longer something that
makes some members feel unappreciated and is instead a process where coaches and captains figure out how to put each member of the program
in a position to be successful.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Better communicate stack rules and expectations to the full program, but especially captains and coaches,
		to ensure the process is as smooth and transparent as possible</li>
	<li>Create a system to nominate fall and winter captains to incorporate program input into captain selection</li>
	<li>Have a conversation about split stacking C and D team. This process would evenly distribute the members of C and D team across two teams,
	which would help new members meet and learn from more experienced members. This process is a complicated one that has a lot of benefits and drawbacks,
	which is why I think we need to have a larger conversation, prioritizing the opinions of members of C and D from this year.</li>
</ul>
