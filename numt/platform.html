<p style="margin-top: 5vh;">Dear NUMT,</p>

<br>
<p>
	First and foremost, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to be on exec these two past years. There's truly been no better activity at
	Northwestern and no better group of people than the ones I've met through mock trial, i.e., you all.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	When I originally ran for exec as a freshman, it's because I loved this program, but thought it could do better. That's been true every year I've been on exec, and it's still true now!
	</p><br>

	<p>This year, I want to build upon the work exec has done in the last few years to keep pushing us toward an NUMT that is not only
	a kick<span class="numbers">-</span>ass top <span class="numbers">10</span> at Nationals team, but also an organization that makes people feel
	supported and appreciated. I don't belive that competitiveness comes at the sacrifice of prioritizing people, in fact, I think it's the opposite.<br><br>My philosophy boils down to this:</p>
	<br>
	<h2><span class="orangehighlight">We compete better when we take care of each other.</span></h2>
	<br>
	<p>We all already know this is true. During this year's tryouts, exec added personality questions to the process. The motivation was fundamentally the statement above:
	we recognized that success isn't just about talent, it's about cohesion.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The result was an incredible class of new members that not only led us to our most successful fall and winter seasons potentially ever, but also were kind and
	supportive team members during an incredibly challenging year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>That philosophy has guided the decisions I've made as a member of exec, and I want to make sure it's at the forefront of our leadership next year, too.</p>
	<br>
	<p>As a member of exec, I've:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>Written and passed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YyU52YVPBdJiisR6ldvBsmH-88jkqCJwsgYK8v9R8uY/edit" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">an amendment</a></span> to make the stack process more personal by mandating that coaches contact members individually to discuss their results</li>
			<li>Created a program wide <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=dS5ub3J0aHdlc3Rlcm4uZWR1XzJrNWpnMzNxOW50dDBsZWNkdHJpYzRlM21nQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">Google Calendar</span></a> to try to facilitate interteam collaboration</li>
			<li>Created an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHbEcX3lMeH7vCFcLMcvwlHPBCGAvpzpi5UZ5fDDvxDlocBg/viewform" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">anonymous feedback form</span></a> to ensure members have a channel to candidly communicate feedback, and also report uncomfortable incidents if necessary</li>
			<li>Adapted to online recruitment via an increased social media presence and a <span class="highlight"><a href="https://meganmunce.github.io/NUMockTrial/Recruitment2020/welcome" target="_blank">custom recruitment website</span><a/></li>
			<li>Added a <a href="https://www.northwesternmocktrial.org/member-resources" target="_blank"><span class="highlight">member resources section </span></a>to the website to aggregate our online resources, new and old</li>
			<li>Represented NUMT's interests outside of our program as part of AMTA's Student Advisory Board, also forming connections with other top programs that led to some great scrimmages</li>
	</ul>

<div class="postitnoteleft" style="float:left; padding-bottom: 1.5vw; margin-bottom: 3vw;"><span style="text-align: center;">Note:</span><br>All of the blue<br>highlighted words<br> are links!</div>

	<p>That's all to say that I'm someone you can trust to follow through with what they say. Each of the bullet points above started as part of my platform for exec last year and became a reality that <span class="numbers">(</span>I hope!<span class="numbers">)</span> improved the state of the program this year.</p>
	<br>
	<p>But like I said at the beginning, there's still so much work to do.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Here are just a few of what my priorities would be as president:</p>


<div class="postitnoteright flipthis" style="float: right; margin-left: 5vw; margin-top: 5vw; margin-bottom: 5vw; width: 20vw; padding-bottom: 0;">
	<p style="font-size: 18px;">Roles of the President:<br></p>
	<ul>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall oversee and assist the operations of the Executive Board and ensure that they are appropriate and efficient</li>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall oversee and introduce the coaches of the program, ensuring that they understand their roles in the organization.</li>
		<li style=" font-size: 16px;">The President shall represent the program when the presidential presence is necessary, including to some funding organizations and to the Student Organization Finance Office <span style=" font-size: 16px;" class="numbers">(</span>SOFO<span style=" font-size: 16px;" class="numbers">)</span></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<br>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Incorporate more program input into program decisions</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">The role of exec is to make decisions for the team, but if we want to do that well, we need to make sure we understand what the team needs and give them a way to communicate whether they think that's being achieved.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hold pre-season full program meeting to discuss priorities for recruitment, i.e. more character witneses, and for the upcoming year, i.e. more all program meetings, more skill sessions, etc.</li>
	<li>Schedule quarterly townhalls for exec to communicate progress on priorities and for members give exec feedback on how to continue to improve </li>
	<li>Better promote the feedback form as an option for communicating feedback between townhalls</li>
	<li>Organize new member conversations, like Wildcat Welcome TNDs, to discuss team expectations and also how to best help new members feel supported</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Focus on growth and goals</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Each of us comes to NUMT with different goals in mind: to be on a certain team, to do a certain role or just to have fun. Keeping that in mind, we need to improve our communication
	about goals and areas for improvement so that coaches, captains and exec can understand how to best improve members' experience and
	members can understand what they need to do to meet their goals.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Rewrite pre-season Google forms to better understand each members' goals so captains and coaches know what to work on with each member</li>
	<li>Use stack result conversations to identify barriers to and opportunities for improvement so members know what to work on during winter</li>
	<li>Create a standardized fall education curriculum so new members on every team recieve a similar fall education</li>
	<li>Play an active role in organizing inter<span class="numbers">-</span>team practices and scrimmages so teams learn from each other and get to know each other</li>
	<li>Organize inter<span class="numbers">-</span>team role<span class="numbers">-</span>based practices <span class="numbers">(</span>i.e., all expert attorneys<span class="numbers">)</span> so members can learn from and bond with people outside their own teams</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Prioritize equity and diversity in coaching</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">We saw this year the difference that having several devoted coaches made on our program. Unfortunately, that may present a problem when we
move back to in person practices and competitions. However, we can also use that as an opportunity to diversify our coaching staff and prioritize giving teams equitable access to coaching.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recruit coaches of color and women coaches to reflect the diversity of NUMT</li>
	<li>Seek more coaches with diversity of experience <span class="numbers">-</span> trial attorneys with and without mock trial experience, alumni with acting experience, etc.</li>
	<li>Check in with fall and winter captains regularly to ensure each teach is receiving equal coaching and is satisfied with their coaching, and find solutions if they aren't</li>
	<li>Focus coaching attention on lower teams if we need to, recognizing that historically when we lack coaches the lower teams are the ones who typically lose out</li>
	<li>Invite alumni to host casual office hours to practice objections and run or edit directs and crosses so alumni without the capacity to coach full time can still pass on their knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size: 25px;"><span class="orangehighlight">Reexamine stack</span></h3>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Stack needs to be redefined so it's no longer something that
makes some members feel unappreciated and is instead a process where coaches and captains figure out how to put each member of the program
in a position to be successful.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hold meetings with the full program and with all potential captains before the night of stack to go over stack rules and expectations in order to make the process as transparent and smooth as possible</li>
	<li>Encourage coaches to read over stack preference forms well before stack so they have the opportunity to ask members clarifying questions in order to better understand how to prioritize their preferences during stack</li>
	<li>Create a system to nominate fall and winter captains for coaches to consider during captain selection to incorporate members' input into who captains them</li>
	<li>Have a conversation about split stacking C and D team. This process would evenly distribute the members of C and D team across two teams, and it's actually what we currently have written in our constitution.
		After Doom and CA<span class="numbers">$</span>H's amazing results this year, it's undeniable that our C and D team are at and above the caliber of many other programs' A teams.
		There are many benefits to split stacking, such as giving new members more chances to learn from older members, but it's ultimately a complicated decision.
		That's why I think we need to consider is as an option in a larger conversation, prioritizing the opinions of members of C and D from this year.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>To quote my good friend Tarot Card Readers' Association of Midlands v. Merrell Dow, this list is not dispositive! <span style="font-size: 17px;">Haha so cool and fun right guys</span></p>
<br>
<p>There are a ton of other ideas I have, and I'm also so excited to work with other elected members of exec on achieving the amazing goals that everyone has been putting in their platforms already. </p>
<br>
<p>To me, good leadership is a healthy blend of idealism, realism and prioritization. This list is a product of talking to past presidents, listening to your feedback at the town hall and in conversations, and reflecting on the past three years of this program to figure out what we need to keep this program on its amazing trajectory moving forward and
	what parts of those priorities fit into the role of the president.</p>


<div style="transform: rotate(-6deg); margin: 1vw; float: left; width: 25vw; margin-right: 3vw;">
<img src="happy2.png" style="width: 25vw; height: auto; margin: 0.5vw;">
<p style="font-size: 18px">And another one for fun :<span class="numbers" style="font-size: 16px;">)</span></p>
</div>

<br>
<p>I'm so proud of what this team has done, and I'm also incredibly excited for its future. If you ever want to talk about any of these priorities and ideas before or after the election, I'm always here at <span class="numbers">(408) 500-2488</span> and more than down to text, call, get coffee or walk.</p>
<br>
<p>I want to end this platform by saying thank you again to literally every person on this program for making NUMT an incredible place not just to compete but to find friends and teammates, and also to everyone spending the time reading this long ass platform.</p>
<br>
<p>I won't get emo, but if I was being emo, I'd say that NUMT has been one of the best parts of my college experience and one hundred percent of it was getting to know all of you. My goal above everything is to make
sure each and every one of you feels like your voice is heard and valued by the leadership of this program, and in the future I hope you won't hesitate to reach out to me, other members
of exec, or the feedback form to let us know any possible thing, big or small, we can do to make your NUMT experience better.</p>
