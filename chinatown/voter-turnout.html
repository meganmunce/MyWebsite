  <p class="preview">In the city of Chicago, every voting precinct in every ward has a designated polling place. But according to data from the Chicago Board of Elections, voting precicnts are increasingly sharing their polling location with other precincts.
  Though advocates say this can create logistical issues for voter turnout, experts aren't sold on whether this will make a large impact on elections going forward.</p>

<section>

  <p>In the past six years, 31 polling locations have been removed from Chicago’s 11th and 25th wards — the two wards that encompass the city’s Chinatown. Of those, only 16 were replaced with new locations, according to data by the Chicago Board of Elections.</p>

<div id="chinatownmap" class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/10136637"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

  <p>Part of the reason — according to voter turnout advocates and election officials — was logistical issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. But Chicago is also part of a <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/30/midterm-elections-closed-voting-sites-impact-minority-voter-turnout/1774221002/" target="_blank" alt="Link to USA Today story on closing polling places in minority-majority cities">
    nationwide trend of polling places closing in minority-majority cities,</a> according to an analysis by USA Today.</p>

  <p>Explore how and why these polling locations have changed over the years, and what impact it might have on future elections in Chicago.</p>

<h3>How do polling places get selected?</h3>

  <p>Chicago’s 50 wards are split up into individual voting precincts, each of which is assigned its own polling location.</p>

  <p>According to Max Bever, director of public information for the Chicago Board of Elections, the Board looks for public buildings like schools or parks within each voting precinct, prioritizing buildings with easily-accessible first floors.</p>

  <p>Bever pointed to multiple factors to explain the trend of more precincts sharing the same polling locations in 2022 compared to 2016. He said minimum space requirements for polling places have risen in recent years, from 675 square feet in 2016 to 800 square feet in 2020 and 2022. This meant that some past polling places no longer qualified.</p>

  <p>He also said, during the pandemic, the Election Board’s polling places division has seen a wave of opt-outs from traditional polling places.</p>

  <p>Jane Lau, who’s in charge of Chinese voter outreach at the Chicago Board of Elections, backed up these reasons. She mentioned the 2016 polling locations at CASL Senior Housing and Chinatown Elderly Apartments opted out from being polling locations during the pandemic due to health concerns for the elderly. Therefore, Haines Elementary School, an existing polling place, became the shared location for three precincts.</p>

  <p>The school’s large auditorium meant it had the capacity to accommodate the three precincts’ voting places. There were still three bilingual election judges at the one location.</p>

  <p>“The number of precincts remains the same, but you will see the actual locations have been decreasing,” Lau said.</p>

  <p>Since there are now more polling locations that host multiple precincts and fewer physical locations, this means there are now more registered voters per polling location in Chinatown.</p>

<h3>How do polling locations impact turnout?</h3>

<div id="precinctbargraph" class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/10206862"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

  <p>Lin Mei, a former Democracy Project 2020 fellow with the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, said when polling places move it can create logistical challenges for volunteers attempting to increase voter turnout.</p>

  <p>In 2020, Mei said that the central library — which has traditionally served as a polling location for Chinatown — wasn’t used due to concerns about accessibility and social distancing.</p>

  <p><q>Some people didn’t see, or even people arrived at the library thinking it was the polling location and it wasn’t,</q> she said. <q>We had to take that into account and provide rides for them to get to the other location, especially if they were elders.</q><p>

  <p>Kim Leung, the Voting Rights Legal Fellow at Asian Americans Advancing Justice’s Chicago branch, said the way that the Board of Elections is communicating these changing polling locations to the Chinatown community is important. She noted for many people, voting is habitual. People who usually go to the same polling place may be confused if there isn’t clear information, specifically information in a language they can understand, pointing to a different location.</p>

  <p><q>How is the Board of Elections making sure that there is notice [of these changes] and notices in different languages?</q> Leung said. <q>Are you just updating your Chicago Board of Elections website? Or are you also going through different media avenues that are popular among those communities? Are you posting physical signs up in the old voting locations in different languages?</q></p>

<h3>What does this mean for elections?</h3>

  <p>So, what does all this mean when it comes down to elections and their results?</p>

  <p>According to Dr. Anthony Fowler, an associate professor in the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, the answer may be that it actually doesn’t mean all that much.</p>

  <p>On the one hand, Fowler acknowledged that the closing and moving of polling sites does have a tangible effect on political participation, mostly because it creates more of a hassle to do something that many people aren’t overly excited to in the first place.</p>

  <p><q>All of the kinds of obvious results that you would expect are there,</q> Fowler said. <q>When you close down polling places and all of sudden people have to go to a new polling place or have to travel further than they used to have to travel, that does have a quantifiable effect on political participation.</q><p>

  <p>The bigger question for Fowler is the magnitude of that effect.</p>

  <p><q>[The effect] isn’t huge,</q> Fowler said. <q>The effects are around one to two percentage points. That’s kind of the general rule for most of these electoral reforms. The effects are pretty modest whether it’s mail-in voting, early voting, same day registration or voter ID rules despite what both political parties will say about them.</q></p>

  <p>Through Fowler’s research, which is focused on empirical data surrounding elections and political representation, he has reached the conclusion that the individual voting reforms often emphasized in political debates will not have a colossal impact.</p>

<figcaption>From this graph, we see an increase in the number of registered voters per polling locations in the 11th and 25th wards over the years. It’s important to note that the jump between 2012 and 2016 is due to an increase in the number of registered voters, while the jump between 2016 and 2020 is due to a decrease in polling locations.</figcaption>
</figure>

  <p><q>I don’t think we’ve found a really compelling example of some reform or anything like that that can significantly increase the representatives of the electorate other than something pretty extreme like compulsory voting,</q> Fowler said.</p>

  <p>According to Fowler, this issue largely stems from the fact that, because of how elections in America work, people recognize that one singular vote will very likely not have an impact on any large election. So, because of this, many people, especially younger and lower-income people with less resources, decide that voting isn’t worth the hassle that it causes.</p>

  <p><q>The chance that your vote is going to make a difference in a large election is essentially zero,</q> Fowler said.</p>

  <p>But even though increasing accessibility to polling places may not be enough to draw a significant number of new voters, Fowler said that losing these polling sites could lead to the consequence of losing existing voters due to the increased burden.</p>

  <p>And while one to two percentage points may not seem like enough to swing an election, that’s not always the case.</p>

  <p>In the year of 2020, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won the state of Georgia’s two Senate seats by a margin of victory of 0.83% and 1.68%, respectively. In that same year, Illinois’ 14th congressional district was won by Lauren Underwood with a margin of victory of 1.34%.</p>

  <h3>How do I find my polling location?</h3>

  <p>The Chicago Board of Elections offers <a href="https://chicagoelections.gov/en/your-voter-information.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to Chicago Board of Elections website tool to input address and find nearest polling location">an online lookup tool</a> where voters can type in their address and find their correct polling locations. Starting May 31, Chicago residents can cast their vote early at
    <a href="https://www.chicagoelections.gov/en/early-voting.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to the Chicago Board of Elections website list of early voting locations for the 2022 election"> any of the city’s early voting locations</a>, Bever said.</p>

  <p>Chicago voters can also <a href="https://chicagoelections.gov/en/vote-by-mail.html" target="_blank" alt="Link to Chicago Board of Elections website online application to vote by mail.">apply to vote by mail</a> through the Board of Elections’ website.</p>

  <div id="methodologyp" class="hidden">
    <p>All data about polling places and their addresses was obtained as lists by contacting the Chicago Board of Elections.</p>

    <p>To find which voting locations had been closed, moved or spread across multiple precincts for wards 11 and 25, we compared addresses for each precinct’s voting location in 2012, 2016, 2020 and 2022. After scraping the names and addresses of the polling locations from the pdfs using Tabula and importing them into a Google Sheet,  we used Google Maps to find latitude and longitude coordinates for each location.</p>

    <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XXXUTap8NF3c6MjUCvAs7VPtSOAE5luBBzSPlD--LB0/edit#gid=752113632" target="_blank">See the list of locations per year here</a>.</p>

    <p>To find the number of registered voters per ward and precinct, we scraped data off the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners’ website. <a href="https://chicagoelections.gov/en/election-results-specifics.asp" target="_blank"> Find that data here</a>. For our third visualization, we did our calculation by dividing the number of registered voters each year by the number of unique polling locations. The number of registered voters for 2022 has not been released, so we did not include that in the data.</p>

    <p>The second data visualization was created by filtering our Google Sheets database to narrow down polling places that were used by multiple precincts in both 2016 and 2022. Then, we created the bar graph to show how many of these kinds of polling places are present in 2022 compared to 2016.</p>
