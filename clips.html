    <h3><q>Your dues are political</q>: NU Greek Life grapples with financial relationship to FratPac</h3>
    <p>Amid a growing anti-Greek Life movement on campus, students took to social media to decry the financial relationship between Greek Life and the Fraternity & Sorority PAC.</p>
    <p>This story was a feature and a fact-check on social media rumors that Northwestern Greek Life dues were funding prominent Republicans' re-election campaigns. My reporting entailed using Google Sheets to scrape data from OpenSecrets.org to tally up the PAC's contributions and using Tableau to explore different visualizations before they were finalized in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

    <h3>Desi-American women fight period stigma during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month</h3>
    <p>Three Desi-American women used the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to start a student organization at Northwestern advocating for menstrual equity using social media posts, online petitions and group letter writing Zoom meetings.</p>
    <p>While writing this feature, I wanted to focus on telling the story of the organization's creation with momentum. Reporting and writing this story gave me insight into integrating identity into stories and using pacing to convey speed and time in my writing.</p>

    <h3>Supreme Court decision disrupts students’ voting plan</h3>
    <p>After the Supreme Court reversed a district court's decision to extend the absentee ballot deadline, many Wisconsin residents &#8212; including Northwestern students voting by mail &#8212; scrambled to get their ballots in on time.</p>
    <p>I conducted the majority of the reporting and writing for this article on a quick deadline. This story taught me effective techniques about sourcing quickly over social media and writing on a quick deadline.</p>

    <h3>Memorial to a memorial: University plans to replace removed memorial to students who died while at Northwestern</h3>
    <p>Students expressed outrage and grief after a long-standing memorial to deceased students was removed without warning.</p>
    <p>I sourced this story from social media after seeing photos going around of the memorial tree being removed and also used advanced search filters on Twitter to narrow down the timeline of the tree's removal using students' tweets. This allowed me to fact-check important details of the story, including the administration's timeline and the names on the tree. Interviewing for this story also required empathy and careful listening as sources recounted stories of the memorial and students whose names are on it.</p>

  <h3>Chicago experiences unprecedented rise in carjackings</h3>
  <p>This was an assignment for class to take an already-published story from a local publication and use jQuery and data visualizations to make it interactive, along with creating and designing the web page with HTML and CSS. I sorted and cleaned data from the Chicago Data Portal about motor vehicle thefts in Chicago and visualized it using Flourish. I also used jQuery elements to add to the published story with tips for the reader and related stories. This project helped my familiarity with taking data off government websites and creating interactive elements with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

  <h3>Working Spotify Interface</h3>
  <p>This was an assiment for EECS 130: Tools of the Worldwide Web, where I improved my fluency in HTML, CSS and Javascript. This focus of this assignment was using CSS to recreate the Spotify interface and then working with the Spotify API so users can search for artists, generate a list of tracks and preview those tracks.</p>

  <h3>Northwestern political scientists call for Trump’s removal</h3>
  <p>Less than 24 hours after the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, six Northwestern political scientists had signed a letter circulated online calling for President Donald Trump's removal.</p>
  <p>This story was written on incredibly tight timeline. I learned about the letter through social media on the night of Jan. 6 and turned around this story less than 24 hours later. This story highlighted my ability to report and write quickly on the local angle to a major political event.</p>

  <h3>Polling results spell trouble for Trump, governor reelection campaigns</h3>
  <p>Leading up to the 2020 election, President Donald Trump suffered a major drop in approval ratings for his COVID-19 response. This trend was also mirrored across several states.</p>
  <p>In this article, I sorted through political polling results from a research consortium and interviewed both a researcher and several students about the results.</p>
