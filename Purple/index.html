    <div class="aboutcontent">
    <p>After growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area, I went to college at Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications and earned both my B.S. and M.S. in journalism through Medill's Accelerated Masters Program.</p>
    <p>During college, I took classes in computer science, Spanish, political science and legal studies, while also <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/staff_name/megan-munce/" target="_blank">working at The Daily Northwestern</a> and serving as president of <a href="https://dailynorthwestern.com/2022/04/21/campus/northwestern-mock-trial-wins-eighth-place-in-national-competition/" target="_blank">Northwestern's nationally renound mock trial team</a>.</p>
    <p>I also interned doing audience engagement research and data analysis for KQED, the Bay Area's NPR and PBS member station, and did <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/megan-munce/" target="_blank">two fellowships with The Texas Tribune</a>: one in reporting, and another in audience engagement.</p>

        <h3>'Souls to the Polls' event draws Black churchgoers to vote early in northwest Houston</h3>
        <p>Hundreds of Black churchgoers formed a miles-long caravan of vehicles to cast their votes after church in a "Souls to the Polls" event. A recent study found that Black voters in Texas are disproportionately likely to have their mail-in ballots and their mail-in ballot applications rejected under a 2021 state law that restricts voting by mail.</p>

        <h3>When the Astros win big, so do Houston's businesses</h3>
        <p>Baseball fans across America have been demanding, “We want Houston.” And
